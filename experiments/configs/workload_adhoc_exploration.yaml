# Ad-Hoc Analyst Exploration
# =============================================================================
# Models 3-5 data analysts doing exploratory analysis. Each starts with
# simple queries to orient themselves, then progressively runs heavier
# analytical queries as they dig deeper. Long think times (reading results,
# adjusting filters). Realistic for a Tuesday afternoon data investigation.
